Ping Pong Game
I have created a Ping Pong game using Python. In this game, players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points by getting the ball past their opponent's paddle. The game loop continuously updates the positions of the paddles and the ball, checks for collisions, and redraws the game state on the screen. I have used the python library - Turtle.

Usage: 
The usage of such a game can range from entertainment to educational purposes, as it helps in understanding basic game development concepts, event handling, and real-time graphics rendering.
